# Optimizing Images Using ImageOptim

* * *

## What is ImageOptim

ImageOptim is a tool for optimizing images for use on the web. It helps us easily reduce the size of our images for creating a better user experience.

## Where to get it

If you do not already have it, ImageOptim can be downloaded for free on [their website](https://imageoptim.com/). It is available for [MacOS](https://imageoptim.com/mac) and [other operating systems](https://imageoptim.com/versions).

## How to use

ImageOptim is most easily used by dragging and dropping images into its interface.

To get started, open up ImageOptim and open the folder that has the image you want to optimize. Notice the large file size of the image. We want to reduce this significantly before using it online.

Click the gear icon to open the settings window if necessary. ImageOptim will remember your settings, so you should only need to access this if you won't be using the same settings all the time.

This following image shows the quality settings window. You can use these options to toggle lossy minifaction on or off and to set the desired quality level for the image. It is ideal to leave lossy minification off (unchecked) when possible, but some images may require it to see significant filesize reduction. The image we are working with today is one of those images, so the option will remain enabled.

The other thing to pay attention to in this window is the image quality itself. The default setting of 80% is a good setting to use. If any adjustments are needed the sliders can be used to change the quality level. Any settings will save automatically, so you can close this window when you are done.

When ready, drag the image file from the folder to ImageOptim and it will automatically optimize it.

The optimized image will automatically replace the orginal file, so it is ideal to keep an original copy of the file saved in a different folder in case it is needed in the future. The new, optimized file is ready to be used online!

## Recommended file structure

A good way of keeping everything organized is to dedicate a folder to images with one subfolder for originals and one for optimized images as follows.
